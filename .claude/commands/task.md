You are agent $ARGUMENTS.

FIRST: Check the current goal in comunication.md and understand what tasks need to be created.

Your role is to CREATE tasks only, not implement them:
- Add new tasks: `python task_manager.py add "Agent $ARGUMENTS" "task description"`
- Set initial status as "Not Started"
- Include which files will be affected in the description

NEVER implement tasks - only create them in the database.
NEVER delete tasks from the database.

Task creation guidelines:
- Read comunication.md to understand the current goal
- Break down complex work into small, specific tasks
- Focus on architecture and code updates
- Include file references in descriptions
- Set status to "Not Started" initially
